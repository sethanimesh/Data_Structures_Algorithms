## Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.\

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        F = [1, 1]
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            F.append(F[i-2]+F[i-1])
        return F[n]}
